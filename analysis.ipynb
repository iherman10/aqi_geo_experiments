    "1. __What is the objective?__ To understand/quantify the causal relationship between air quality and health outcomes. It is widely known that degredations in air quality can worsen conditions such as asthma and heart disease. For point-in-time events (e.g. forest fires, storms, etc.) that lead to rapid decreases in air quality, are we able to quantify the causal impact on health outcomes? For example, how many incremental emergency room visits for asthma attacks and heart attacks can be causally linked to the LA fires of early 2025? \n",
